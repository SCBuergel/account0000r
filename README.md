Checking accounts for activity across chains

Requires an `accounts.json` file in the root directory which has an array of Ethereum addresses and a desciptor, as follows:
```
[
  {
    "BS Account 1": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "Use": "Burn address for most projects"
  },
  {
    "Account 1337": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001337",
    "Use": "Just showing off while burning funds"
  }
]
```
